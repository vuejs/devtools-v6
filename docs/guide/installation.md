# Installation

The Vue.js devtools allows you to inspect and debug your applications.

## Chrome

Install the extension on the Chrome Web Store:

### Settings

If you need to use the devtools in incognito mode or when you open an HTML file directly, you need to change the extension settings.

1. Go to the extensions:

## Standalone

In case you are using an unsupported browser, or if you have other specific needs (for example your application is in Electron), you can use the standalone application.

Install the package globally:
```bash
npm install -g @vue/devtools
```

Or locally as project dependency:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @vue/devtools
```

### Using global package

Once you installed the package globally, run:
```bash
vue-devtools
```

Then add this code to the `<head>` section of your application HTML file:
```html
<script src="http://localhost:8098"></script>
```

Or if you want to debug your device remotely:
```html
<script>
  window.__VUE_DEVTOOLS_HOST__ = '<your-local-ip>' // default: localhost
  window.__VUE_DEVTOOLS_PORT__ = '<devtools-port>' // default: 8098
</script>
<script src="http://<your-local-ip>:8098"></script>
```

**(Don't forget to remove it before deploying to production!)**

`<your-local-ip>` usually looks like this: `192.168.x.x`.

Then start your development server like you are used to, *without* killing the `vue-devtools` command (for example, open a new terminal). Both need to run in parallel.

```bash
yarn dev
#or
yarn serve
```

### Using dependency package

Once you installed the package as project dependency, run:
```bash
./node_modules/.bin/vue-devtools
```

You can also use the global `vue-devtools` to start the app, but you might want to check if the local version matches the global one in this scenario to avoid any incompatibilities.

Then import it directly in your app:
```js
import devtools from '@vue/devtools'
// import Vue from 'vue'
```
> Make sure you import devtools before Vue, otherwise it might not work as expected.

And connect to host:
```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  devtools.connect(/* host, port */)
}
```

**host** - is an optional argument that tells your application where devtools middleware server is running, if you debug your app on your computer you don't have to set this (the default is `http://localhost`), but if you want to debug your app on mobile devices, you might want to pass your local IP (e.g. `http://192.168.1.12`).

**port** - is an optional argument that tells your application on what port devtools middleware server is running. If you use proxy server, you might want to set it to `null` so the port won't be added to connection URL.
