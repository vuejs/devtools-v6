        **Before You Start...**

        This form is only for submitting bug reports. If you have a usage question
        or are unsure if this is really a bug, make sure to:

        - Read the [docs](https://devtools.vuejs.org/)
        - Read the [FAQ](https://devtools.vuejs.org/guide/faq.html)
        - Ask on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vuejs/devtools/discussions)
        - Ask on [Discord Chat](https://chat.vuejs.org/)

        Also try to search for your issue - it may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch.
        However, if you find that an old, closed issue still persists in the latest version,
        you should open a new issue using the form below instead of commenting on the old issue.

    id: version
    attributes:
      label: Vue devtools version

        Open your browser Extensions page and find the Vue devtools extension. Then write in this field the version number shown next to the Vue devtools extension name.

        The easiest way to provide a reproduction is by showing the bug in [The SFC Playground](https://sfc.vuejs.org/).
        If it cannot be reproduced in the playground and requires a proper build setup, try [StackBlitz](https://vite.new/vue).
        If neither of these are suitable, you can always provide a GitHub repository.

        The reproduction should be **minimal** - i.e. it should contain only the bare minimum amount of code needed
        to show the bug. See [Bug Reproduction Guidelines](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/.github/bug-repro-guidelines.md) for more details.

        Please do not just fill in a random link. The issue will be closed if no valid reproduction is provided.

        What do we need to do after opening your repro in order to make the bug happen in the devtools? Clear and concise reproduction instructions are important for us to be able to triage your issue in a timely manner. Note that you can upload screenshots and use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to format lists and code.
